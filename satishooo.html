	<h3><u><center>SURVIVAL SKILLS</center></u></h3>
	Survival skills are techniques that a person may use in order to sustain life in any type of natural environment or built environment. These techniques are meant to provide basic necessities for human life which include water, food, and shelter. The skills also support proper knowledge and interactions with animals and plants to promote the sustaining of life over a period of time. Survival skills are often associated with the need to survive in a disaster situation.

	<li><b><u><h4>First AID</h4></u></b></li>
	
A first aid kit containing equipment to treat common injuries and illness
First aid (wilderness first aid in particular) can help a person survive and function with injuries and illnesses that would otherwise kill or incapacitate him/her
	<br><br>
	<li><b><u>Shelter</u></b></li>
	A shelter can range from a natural shelter, such as a cave, overhanging rock outcrop, or fallen-down tree, 
	to an intermediate form of man-made shelter such as a debris hut, tree pit shelter, or snow cave, to completely 
	man-made structures such as a tarp, tent, or longhouse.
	<br><br>
	<li><b><u>Fire</u></b></li>
	Making fire is recognized in the sources as significantly increasing the ability to survive physically and mentally. Lighting a fire without a lighter or matches, e.g. by using natural flint and steel with tinder, is a frequent subject of both books on survival and in survival courses. There is an emphasis placed on practicing fire-making skills before venturing into the wilderness. Producing fire under adverse conditions has been made much easier by the introduction of tools such as the solar spark lighter and the fire piston.

	<li><b><u>WATER</u></b></li>
	A human being can survive an average of three to five days without the intake of water. The issues presented by the need for water dictate that unnecessary water loss by perspiration be avoided in survival situations. The need for water increases with exercise.[4]

A typical person will lose minimally two to maximally four liters of water per day under ordinary conditions, and more in hot, dry, or cold weather. Four to six liters of water or other liquids are generally required each day in the wilderness to avoid dehydration and to keep the body functioning properly.[5] The U.S. Army survival manual does not recommend drinking water only when thirsty, as this leads to underhydrating. Instead, water should be drunk at regular intervals.[6][7] Other groups recommend rationing water through "water discipline

    <li><b><u>food</u></b></li>
	Focusing on survival until rescued by presumed searchers, the Boy Scouts of America especially discourages foraging for wild foods on the grounds that the knowledge and skills needed are unlikely to be possessed by those finding themselves in a wilderness survival situation, making the risks (including use of energy) outweigh the benefits.[14]

Cockroaches[15], flies [16]and ants[17] can contaminate food, making it unsafe for consumption.
